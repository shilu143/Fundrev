# Backend Documentation

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Javascript
- **Framework:** NodeJS
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Authentication:** JWT
- **Other Tools/Libraries:** [Any other important libraries or tools used]

## Authentication
The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. When a user logs in, a token is generated using a secret key stored in environment variables. This token is then sent to the client and should be included in the header of subsequent requests to authenticate the user. The server verifies the token using the same secret key.


## Workflow
Provide a high-level overview of how the backend works. This could include how requests are handled, how data is processed, how responses are generated, etc. You could also include a diagram to visually represent the workflow.

## API Endpoints
List out all the API endpoints, their purposes, the request method (GET, POST, etc.), required parameters, and the response format.

## Error Handling
Explain how errors are handled in the backend. Include information about how errors are logged, how they are returned in the response, etc.

## Testing
Describe how testing is done for the backend. Include information about the testing framework used, how to run tests, etc.

## Deployment
Provide instructions for how to deploy the backend. This could include required environment variables, necessary commands, etc.

## Contributing
If this is an open-source project, provide guidelines for how others can contribute.

Remember to update this documentation as the backend evolves.
